- **Documentation**: Help improve our docs, examples, or README files
- **Testing**: Help us test new features or edge cases

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for TypeScript components)
- Go 1.21+ (for CLI)

3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

### Component-Specific Guidelines

#### broker-core & broker-server (TypeScript/Node.js)
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

#### cli (Go)
```bash
go mod download
go build -o voidkey main.go
go test ./...
go fmt ./...
```

#### sandbox (Docker)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Test your changes against the sandbox environment
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Run the full test suite** and ensure all tests pass
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### PR Requirements
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows existing style conventions
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] PR description explains the change and why it's needed
- [ ] Commits are well-formed and focused

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines
- Write clear, self-documenting code

## Testing

- All new code should have appropriate tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Include integration tests where applicable

### Running Tests
```bash
# TypeScript components
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Go CLI
go test ./...
go test -race ./...

# End-to-end testing
cd sandbox && ./scripts/e2e-test.sh
```
